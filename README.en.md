# WorkBuddy Hub Android

English | [中文](./README.md)

Connect a WorkBuddy account to any OpenAI-compatible client. The app runs a
local forwarding endpoint on your phone; point your editor, agent, or script at
it and it works — no official API, and no computer required.

```
Phone
├─ WB Hub
│    ├─ OAuth sign-in (China / Global)
│    ├─ Forwarding endpoint  0.0.0.0 / :: :8765 (all interfaces by default)
│    └─ Overlay status panel (keeps the process from being frozen)
│
└─ Any OpenAI-compatible client
     └─ baseUrl = http://127.0.0.1:8765/v1
```

## Features

- **Account access** through the official CLI's OAuth flow — sign in once and the
  credential refreshes itself when it expires
- **Two builds side by side**: the China and Global builds are separate account
  systems, so both can be signed in at once and switched between instantly,
  with no re-login
- **Local forwarding endpoint**, OpenAI-compatible (`/v1/models`,
  `/v1/chat/completions`) with streaming passed through unchanged
- **Overlay keep-alive**: a small status panel keeps the app visible so the
  service is not frozen in the background. It can be dragged, collapsed, and
  its opacity and position lock are adjustable
- **Call history**: every call's model, token counts, and credit cost, with
  totals
- **Check-in and balance**: view remaining credit and claim the daily check-in

## Build

Requires JDK 21 and an Android SDK (with platform 35 and build-tools). Gradle
comes from the project's wrapper, so it does not need to be installed.

### Linux / macOS

```sh
echo "sdk.dir=$HOME/Android/Sdk" > local.properties
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

### Windows

In PowerShell:

```powershell
"sdk.dir=$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Android\Sdk" | Out-File -Encoding ascii local.properties
.\gradlew.bat assembleDebug
```

Adjust the SDK path in `local.properties` to match your installation.

The APK lands in `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

### Install on a device

```sh
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## Usage

1. **Sign in**: open the app → "Credential" → pick a build → tap sign in and
   complete the login in your browser
2. **Start the service**: "API" → turn the switch on
3. **Grant the overlay**: tap "Enable overlay" and allow it. This is what keeps
   the service alive in the background
4. **Point your client at it**: the "API" page shows the baseUrl and apiKey

### Client configuration

A `models.json`-style example:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "workbuddy": {
      "baseUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:8765/v1",
      "api": "openai-completions",
      "apiKey": "wty20061224",
      "models": [
        { "id": "hy3" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Model names are listed on the app's "API" page; tapping one copies it.

## Why the overlay is needed

Android freezes a backgrounded app's process, and a frozen process stops serving
requests — which shows up as client timeouts. A foreground service is not enough
to prevent this: in this project's testing the service was still frozen and
still timed out.

An overlay keeps the app in the "visible" state, which raises its process
importance enough that it is no longer frozen. This needs no root and no extra
tooling — one permission grant in system settings.

## How it works

```
client request
  │  OpenAI protocol
  ▼
local forwarding endpoint (all interfaces 0.0.0.0 / ::, default port 8765)
  │  ① reshape the body (the upstream requires stream, rejects the developer role)
  │  ② add the WorkBuddy-specific identity headers
  │  ③ attach your access token
  ▼
WorkBuddy upstream (copilot.tencent.com / www.workbuddy.ai)
  │  SSE stream
  ▼
passed through to the client unchanged
```

The endpoint listens on every interface by default (IPv4 `0.0.0.0` and IPv6 `::`)
and requires a shared secret on every request, so devices on the same network can
reach it. External access can be turned off in the app, falling back to
`127.0.0.1` only.

The upstream endpoints are the private ones the WorkBuddy client uses, not a
public API. An upstream change can break the integration and would need
matching work here.

## Known limitations

- Overlay keep-alive depends on how the system judges importance; aggressive
  background policies may still restrict it
- A Global account may need its trial activated in the official client first,
  otherwise the upstream refuses billing-related requests
- Depends on private WorkBuddy endpoints, which may need adapting after an
  upstream update
- Verified on Android only
